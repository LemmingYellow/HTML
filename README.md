# HTML
HTML pages that I've created over the years.

/Neopets
    Code is not in HTML format because of Neopets' filters. However, there are imbedded css stylesheets
     and the content that would go into the body tags of a normal HTML page. In many cases, links will
     no longer work because the pages have been overwritten.
     
~ cat page.txt
        Page designed by me to hold the information for my character for my roleplay guild on Neopets.
          
~ Character Page.txt
        Current character page. For my roleplay guild on Neo.
        
~ Coloring Page.txt
        Fridge page that acted as a home for the coloring page of our event for summer time 2016.
        
~ dens code.txt
        Page to hold text descriptions of locations for the guild.
        
~ Egg Page.txt
        Page for egg coloring from our 2016 Easter event. Coded by hand, including locations for eggs.
        
~ Icon Magic Page.txt
        Current page for ordering custom icons. Coded by hand, and I make the icons by hand.
        
~ IconPage.txt
        Original icon page. Coded from scratch.
        
~ Merry Miragemas.txt
        Page designed for our giveaway for Christmas 2016. Intended to be minimalist but nice.
        
~ Mirage Easter.txt
        Similar to the egg page above. I don't remember which was the final one, but here they both are.
        
~ NaNoWriMo16.txt
        The entire page for the National Novel Writing Month event for the guild in 2016. Created the 
        whole page from scratch, and updated the chart via an image captured of an excel spreadsheet.
        
~ newspaperPage.txt
        Page for the newspaper for Mirage. Only occasionally updated, but coded by hand. Intentionally 
        kind of "messy", including the images.
        
~ Pet Page HTML.txt
        Original design of my character page for Mirage. The original css was not mine, but I did some 
        editing and added my own content.
        
~ Portal Page.txt
        Holds portal of links for ease of guild navigation. The background image was created by another 
        guild member, but I created the header image as well as the coding for the buttons.
        
~ Summer Wrap Up Page.txt
        Mapped image with clickable booths. Essentially, this was a portal for the event.
